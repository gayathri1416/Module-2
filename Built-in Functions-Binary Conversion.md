# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert a number into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign a value to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=int(input())
print(bin(a))
```


## Output

## Result
```
Thus the python program to convert the numbers into its binar representation is executed successfully.
